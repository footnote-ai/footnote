/**
 * Derives a conservative run-outcome summary for trace presentation.
 *
 * This is an exported UI-boundary formatter for workflow/provenance metadata.
 * It only uses backend-authored execution/workflow facts and never invents
 * new backend reason codes.
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - Returns a concrete `RunOutcomeSummary` when outcome signals are present.
 * - Returns an `unknown` summary when metadata exists but no definitive path
 *   can be derived.
 * - Returns `null` when neither workflow nor execution metadata is present.
 *
 * Decision assumptions:
 * - `workflow.terminationReason` is treated as the highest-authority stop/completion signal.
 * - Explicit runtime failures outrank inferred completion from generation.
 * - Planner `contractType === "fallback"` is surfaced as fallback posture
 *   without exposing synthesized reason-code strings.
