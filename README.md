Footnote is an AI assistant that tries to show its work — it returns trace metadata you can easily inspect.

Every response includes:

- how confident it is
- what sources it relied on
- what trade-offs it considered
- what constraints and safety checks were applied

Built for human oversight, rather than “just believe me.”

## Try it today

Footnote is a working prototype with:

- **Web demo** with a quick “ask” flow
- **Discord bot** provides seamless and rich interaction
- **Self-hosting** via Docker, or in the cloud (Fly.io)

---

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

> If pnpm isn't available yet, run `corepack enable` once (Node 16.10+), then `pnpm install`

2. Set environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to a new `.env`, edit:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=...
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=...
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=...
DISCORD_USER_ID=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
TRACE_API_TOKEN=...
INCIDENT_PSEUDONYMIZATION_SECRET=...
```

> This is the minimum config—See [.env.example](.env.example) for the full list.

> OpenAI is currently the only LLM provider—Broader model/provider support is planned.

3. Start all services (backend/web/Discord bot)

```bash
pnpm start:all
```

## Vendoring and Multiple Discord Bots

We treat `Footnote` as the default Discord persona. If you do nothing beyond the base setup, the bot runs with this identity.

If you want a vendored bot identity on top of the same backend, configure the bot runtime with profile env vars:

```env
BOT_PROFILE_ID=acme-bot
BOT_PROFILE_DISPLAY_NAME="Acme Assistant"
BOT_PROFILE_PROMPT_OVERLAY=
BOT_PROFILE_PROMPT_OVERLAY_PATH=
BOT_PROFILE_MENTION_ALIASES=
```

If you omit these values, the runtime falls back to the default Footnote identity.

Recommended vendoring workflow:

1. Set a unique `BOT_PROFILE_ID` for the bot machine.
2. Set `BOT_PROFILE_DISPLAY_NAME` for the visible identity.
3. Add either [1] `BOT_PROFILE_PROMPT_OVERLAY` or [2] `BOT_PROFILE_PROMPT_OVERLAY_PATH` for persona-specific instructions (1 takes priority over 2).
4. Add `BOT_PROFILE_MENTION_ALIASES` when the bot should respond to vendor-specific plaintext names.

Base prompt ownership is now shared:

1. Canonical Footnote base prompts live in `packages/prompts/src/defaults.yaml`.
2. `PROMPT_CONFIG_PATH` overrides those same base prompts for both the backend and Discord bot runtime.
3. Vendored bot identity changes should go in `BOT_PROFILE_*` overlay settings, not a forked base prompt file.
