# Multi-Bot Vendoring Plan: Shared Backend + Persona Overrides

**Decision:** Move to a Footnote-default persona model with per-bot vendor overlays so multiple Discord bot machines can share one backend without prompt/identity conflicts.  
**Date:** 2026-03-06

---

## 1. Context

Footnote currently supports one primary Discord bot runtime pattern. The backend reflect path is shared and stable, but persona behavior was still tightly coupled to a legacy single-bot identity and mixed prompt ownership across bot/backend surfaces.

We want to support easier spin-up of multiple Discord bot machines (vendor profiles) that use the same backend.

This requires:

- a clear default persona baseline,
- instance-scoped override points,
- prompt composition that avoids contradictory identity instructions.

---

## 2. Goals

- Keep a single shared backend for multiple Discord bot runtimes.
- Make Footnote the default base persona.
- Let vendors define profile-specific persona behavior using environment-level overrides.
- Prevent prompt conflicts between base persona and vendor persona instructions.
- Preserve provenance, traceability, and existing fail-open behavior.

---

## 3. Decision

### 3.1 Base + overlay model

Adopt a two-layer persona model:

- **Base layer (default):** Footnote-aligned neutral persona and behavior constraints.
- **Overlay layer (vendor):** optional profile-specific instructions injected per bot machine.

### 3.2 Multi-machine architecture boundary

Treat each Discord bot machine as an independent surface adapter that can supply profile context while sharing the same backend orchestration and trace pipeline.

### 3.3 Backward compatibility

If no vendor overlay is configured, the system must behave as Footnote default without breaking existing flows.

---

## 4. High-Level Plan

### Phase 0 - Baseline hardening

- Normalize baseline persona text to Footnote-first language in shared prompts.
- Remove or neutralize hardcoded identity references that would conflict with overlays.
- Keep tone/safety/provenance constraints unchanged.

### Phase 1 - Bot-level profile configuration

- Add bot runtime env variables for profile identity and overlay content.
- Support either inline text override or path-based override (operator-friendly).
- Validate and log active profile config at startup (without leaking sensitive content).

### Phase 2 - Prompt injection path

- Inject vendor overlay instructions into Discord reflect request construction so overrides are instance-scoped.
- Apply the same profile overlay rules to bot-local generation paths (image/realtime/provenance interactions) for consistency.
- Keep fail-open behavior: invalid/missing overlay falls back to base prompt.

### Phase 3 - Mention and engagement consistency

- Centralize mention alias logic so plaintext mention handling is consistent across catchup and engagement paths.
- Ensure default alias set aligns with Footnote default; vendor aliases come from profile env config.

### Phase 4 - Update documentation

- Update this document with final results
- Update root README.md to explain vendoring processes for new users
- Update DeepWiki instruction to explain this system and user processes
- Ensure repo-wide standardization to the default Footnote persona and removal of Ari

---

## 5. Invariants

The implementation must preserve the following invariants:

- **Invariant A:** A bot machine only applies its own configured profile overlay.
- **Invariant B:** Missing/invalid overlay configuration never blocks execution; base persona remains active.
- **Invariant C:** Provenance metadata and trace persistence continue to function unchanged.

---

## 6. Implementation Status

Status as of 2026-03-06:

- **Phase 0:** complete
- **Phase 1:** complete
- **Phase 2:** complete
- **Phase 3:** complete
- **Phase 4:** complete

### Completed results

- Default prompt posture is Footnote-first instead of Ari-first.
- Canonical base prompt ownership now lives in the shared `@footnote/prompts` package instead of separate backend/bot catalogs.
- Bot runtime profile config exists for:
  - profile id
  - profile display name
  - inline or file-based prompt overlay
  - profile-scoped mention aliases
- Prompt overlay injection is wired through:
  - Discord reflect request construction
  - image prompt paths
  - realtime prompt paths
  - provenance interaction prompt paths
- Overlay logging is metadata-only and tested to avoid leaking raw overlay text.
- Plaintext mention alias resolution is centralized and shared across:
  - `MessageCreate` catchup threshold routing
  - `CatchupFilter` no-mention detection
  - `RealtimeEngagementFilter` mention scoring
- Root onboarding docs and DeepWiki-facing vendoring notes now describe the Footnote-default model.

### Remaining implementation work

- None for the vendoring phases defined in this document.
