# Workflows

A workflow is the path Footnote uses to answer a chat request. It covers the
selected mode, planning, optional context, generation, review, fallback
behavior, and the metadata saved for trace and provenance.

The current chat path supports three public modes: `express`, `balanced`, and
`grounded`.

All three map to the reviewed workflow profile, but they run with different
contract presets, limits, model routing, and evidence posture.

## Stable design vocabulary and boundaries

Use the following small vocabulary when extending workflows:

- **Workflow** describes how work proceeds.
- **Run** is one execution of a workflow.
- **Step** is a named unit of work.
- **Attempt** is one concrete try to complete a Step.
- **Context** is backend-owned request and conversation information available to
  the Run.
- **Result** is a named runtime value produced by a Step.

The work a Run performs is separate from the topology that defines its allowed
path. A Workflow chooses the path, and a model may choose only among validated
outcomes that the Step exposes. Use **Executor** and **Adapter** for
implementation terms. Reserve **Agent** for a genuinely delegated system that
controls its own internal multi-step work or tool use; a single planner, writer,
style, or reviewer call is a model-backed Step, not an Agent.

Keep **Context**, **Result**, and **ModelInput** distinct. Context is what
Footnote knows about the Run. Results are named runtime values from earlier Steps.
ModelInput is the bounded provider-neutral projection assembled for one model
Attempt from the Context, declared Results, Step instructions, policy/persona
material, and allowed capabilities. Do not replace this boundary with one
shared mutable workflow state object or let retrieved text acquire instruction
authority through a prompt role.

Attempt-level recovery handles provider, adapter, or model failures. Workflow
failure routes handle the meaning of a failed Step: an optional failure may
preserve an earlier valid Result, while a required write failure may produce an
explicit no-generation outcome. Both the Attempt facts and the Step outcome
belong in the backend-owned Run record.

Capability reporting must distinguish **supported**, **unsupported**, and
**unknown**, and must distinguish what the concrete model/provider supports from
what the active Adapter/runtime can request or observe. Effective support is the
intersection of those layers; fail-open behavior must not turn unknown into a
false claim.

A delegated Agent may run inside a bounded Agent-backed Step, but it does not
own Footnote's outer Workflow, Execution Contract, provenance, trace, review,
or failure semantics. W3C PROV, OpenTelemetry, A2A, and MCP are useful alignment
or export references, not replacements for Footnote's everyday domain names.

Footnote is pre-production. When a new workflow definition can express the
current path and the cutover is working, remove superseded internal topology
and compatibility machinery rather than maintaining two active workflow
engines indefinitely. Every merged migration PR must leave chat usable.

## Workflow foundation (shipped, not live)

The first foundation slice for #575 lives in
`packages/backend/src/services/workflowCore/`. It provides a small runtime-only
contract: `Workflow`, `Step`, `Run`, `Attempt`, `Result`, declared transitions,
and executor categories for `model`, `context`, `code`, and future delegated
`agent` work. It does not claim Step-to-executor dataflow at compile time.
Executors receive the full Step, run context, selected named Results, and
one-based Run and Attempt ordinals. The engine validates declared Result names
at runtime instead.

Before it invokes an executor, the foundation validates the complete Workflow:
the start Step exists, every map key matches its Step id, and every transition
target exists. A successful Attempt must return the Step's declared Result when
one exists. It must not return a Result from an outputless Step. Missing,
mismatched, and undeclared Results reject the Run; unavailable executors remain
a separate configuration rejection from a declared Step failure route.

Both the existing live engine and this foundation use the neutral
`admitExecution()` and `recordExecution()` seams in
`workflowEngine/limits.ts`. That authority owns both limit checks and the
counter semantics used by those checks. Steps supply only resource facts:
tool use or general, planning, or review deliberation. Future verification or
research Steps can consume deliberation capacity without impersonating a
legacy Step name. Presentation supplies no deliberation activity, so its
candidate work remains outside plan/review capacity. A caller calculates a
token reservation per concrete Attempt; the Workflow definition does not bake
a static request budget into a Step. Malformed Execution Contract bounds reject
the foundation Run rather than being silently clamped or removed.

A Run that reaches `end` after a Step exhausts its Attempts and follows a
declared recovery route is `degraded`, not `completed`. A retryable Attempt
that succeeds within its Step is normal error correction and leaves the Run
`completed`; all Attempts remain available in the trace.

`reviewedChatWorkflow.ts` is an honest, non-live proof of the current coarse
reviewed-chat shape:

```text
plan -> context -> presentation -> write -> review -> finish -> end
  |
  +-> default-plan recovery -> context

review -- revise --> replan -- continue/skipped --> write
                             |
                             +-> failed -> finish
```

The planner's failure route invokes the explicit conservative default-plan code
Step. A failed default-plan Step routes through finish. Presentation is one
Step whose executor owns candidate generation and deterministic admissibility;
this proof does not include separate style-check or presentation retry Steps.
Revision re-enters planning explicitly, and the revision Write consumes the
Review Result and optional revision Plan. A replan that is skipped continues
revision; one that fails finalizes the last good Draft instead. Finish
can consume the Draft, Plan terminal action, context Result, and Review Result
that led to finalization. Write and review failure routes go through the
semantic `finish` Step before the terminal `end`, so finalization and
no-generation handling are represented rather than bypassed.

This foundation deliberately does not cut live chat over, add durable result
storage, add a generic workflow DSL, unify model controls, migrate Context or
ModelInput, or migrate canonical execution records. Strong compile-time linked
dataflow remains deferred to #577; #576 and #578 remain separate work. The
later cutover should prove equivalent user-visible behavior and delete
superseded topology instead of carrying a compatibility engine.

## How a chat request runs

The normal chat path starts in `chatOrchestrator` and then moves through the
backend workflow runtime.

1. `chatOrchestrator` receives and normalizes the request.
2. The Execution Contract sets the allowed behavior and limits.
3. The backend resolves the workflow mode and runtime config.
4. `chatOrchestrator` provides the planner and context-step dependencies used
   during workflow execution.
5. `chatService` runs `workflowEngine` with the reviewed workflow shape.
6. Response metadata records the mode outcome, planner influence, workflow
   lineage, cost, trace fields, and provenance fields.

The main runtime pieces are:

- the Execution Contract, which sets the run rules and limits
- the mode, which selects the run posture
- the workflow shape, which defines the step pattern
- the planner, which can suggest how to handle the request within the run rules
- workflow metadata, which records what happened

Workflow logic is split across backend layers:

- Engine core handles transition checks, hard limits, workflow state, and
  termination reasons.
- Workflow profiles describe the step shape and step-specific behavior for one
  workflow kind.
- Adapters and callers assemble requests, call runtimes or providers, persist
  metadata, and connect workflow results to routes.

The engine is the source for step legality and workflow lineage. Profiles
describe the intended workflow. Adapters connect that workflow to the app.

## Modes and workflow shape

The backend resolves three public modes:

- `express`
- `balanced`
- `grounded`

Mode ids are user-facing enough to appear in product copy with normal casing:
`Express`, `Balanced`, and `Grounded`. Internal profile ids are not useful as
primary labels under an answer.

All three modes use the reviewed workflow shape:

| Workflow shape | Purpose                     | Main steps                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `reviewed`     | reviewed message generation | `generate -> assess -> planner re-entry -> generate` |

Mode details:

| Mode       | Contract preset    | Workflow shape | Flow                | Review | Evidence posture |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| `express`  | `fast-direct`      | `reviewed`     | lower-allowance run | gated  | minimal          |
| `balanced` | `balanced`         | `reviewed`     | reviewed generation | yes    | balanced         |
| `grounded` | `quality-grounded` | `reviewed`     | reviewed generation | yes    | stricter         |

`Grounded` and `reviewed` describe the path Footnote took. They are not claims
that the answer is true.

Mode selection happens during initial routing:

1. Use the requested mode when it is recognized.
2. If the Execution Contract provides a response mode, map it to the mode:
   `quality_grounded` maps to `grounded`, and `fast_direct` maps to `express`.
3. If no mode is available, use `balanced`.

That fallback keeps the system available with the general default. These
fallback steps happen during initial routing only. Runtime mode escalation is
handled separately.

Mode escalation lives in `resolveWorkflowRuntimeConfig`:

```text
packages/backend/src/services/workflowProfileRegistry.ts
```

That function resolves the initial mode once, then applies at most one
workflow-requested escalation. Recursive mode re-evaluation is not part of the
current path.

## Planning, context, and review

Workflow execution begins with the planner step. Planner timing and plan
lineage come from workflow execution, so trace records can show that planning
happened before generation.

`chatOrchestrator` provides two planner dependencies:

- `PlannerStepExecutor`, which calls the planner during the `plan` step
- `PlanContinuationBuilder`, which applies backend policy and builds the next
  workflow action

`PlanContinuationBuilder` applies planner output through
`PlannerResultApplier`, `classifyPlanContinuation`, and
`assemblePlanGenerationInput`. It chooses either `terminal_action` or
`continue_message`.

Planner output is guidance for the run. It can suggest action shape, search or
tool details, capability profile, response posture, and planner-facing
explanation metadata. The selected mode, profile, Execution Contract, limits,
safety behavior, provenance behavior, and final response behavior still come
from backend policy and runtime config.

Planner information appears in workflow metadata as a `plan` step. Trace copy
can say `Planned, then generated` or `Planner fallback` when metadata supports
that wording. The answer receipt usually mentions planner only when it changes
the user-facing story, such as planner fallback.

### Context steps

Context integrations run before generation through injected executors. Examples
include `weather_forecast`, `web_search`, `file_scan`, `trustgraph`, and
`reverse_image_search`.

The pattern is:

1. `chatOrchestrator` builds a `ContextStepRequest` for the requested
   integration and provides a `ContextStepExecutor`.
2. `chatService` passes those values to `runBoundedReviewWorkflow`.
3. `workflowEngine` executes the context step before `generate`.

Context-step outcomes:

- On success, context messages are injected into the generation prompt.
- On clarification needed, the workflow terminates with `goal_satisfied` and
  returns a user-facing clarification response.
- On failure, the workflow continues fail-open without injected context. The
  no-fabrication guardrail still applies.

This keeps the engine provider-neutral while still letting integrations add
bounded context to generation.

### Review loop

The reviewed workflow runs this bounded path:

```text
generate -> assess(refinementRequested?) -> planner re-entry(guidance) -> generate(refinementApplied?) -> assess(finalize)
```

The `generate` step produces the current draft. The `assess` step returns
`reviewDecision` and `reviewReason`.

`reviewDecision` is either `finalize` or `revise`. When the decision is
`revise`, `assess` may also return `revisionInstruction`. `reviewReason` explains
why revision is needed. `revisionInstruction` gives concrete guidance for the
follow-up refinement `generate` step.

`revisionInstruction` is revise-only and is not recorded for `finalize`.

Assess may also return TRACE alignment outputs:

- `traceAlignment`: `aligned` or `misaligned`
- `traceAlignmentReason`: short reason when `traceAlignment` is `misaligned`
- flattened final posture axes, such as `finalTemperamentTightness`

These assess outputs are used for lineage and metadata finalization. They stay
inside workflow policy and limits.

When optional presentation is enabled, Footnote first makes a conservative
reservation for its prompt and output, authoritative generation, and the first
assessment. Candidate output is counted both as candidate usage and as text
copied into the authoritative prompt. If that reservation cannot
fit, the candidate is skipped fail-open with the serializable presentation
reason `budget_skipped`; authoritative generation still owns the answer, and
provider-reported usage remains the cumulative source of truth.

A presentation model may draft wording and style before the normal answer is
written. Footnote then checks only that the returned draft is usable prose. It
does not ask another model to verify facts, grounding, policy, safety, posture,
TRACE, or persona correctness. Normal answer generation uses the draft only as
a style suggestion while working from authoritative context and making the
answer. The ordinary assessment/revision loop reviews that answer and applies
semantic corrections.

This prose-usability check is called candidate admission in code and contracts.
Old traces remain readable, but the current runtime does not emit or execute
the old validator/audit stages and new runs do not create records for them.

Review decision parsing uses explicit expected-failure results. If assess
output is empty, not a JSON object, invalid JSON, or schema-invalid, the engine
records a failed `assess` step and fails open to the latest successful draft.
The failed step records the parse reason as serializable signals, not raw assess
output.

If the decision is `revise`, the engine may run planner re-entry and then a
follow-up `generate` step for refinement.

During revision generation only, assess hints can reorder the resolved generate
chain before execution:

- logic or grounding hints prefer an OpenAI-first lane
- style hints prefer an Ollama-first lane
- cost hints prefer cheaper candidates while preserving safe ordering
- when hints conflict, logic or grounding takes priority over style

This hint routing is internal and does not add required public API schema
fields.

The loop stops when it reaches a final answer, hits a limit, or fails open.

## Model routing

Model routing is resolved per workflow step. Defaults live in:

```text
packages/backend/src/config/model-profiles.defaults.yaml
```

Each mode resolves independent chains for `planner`, `generate`, and `assess`.
Chain entries can be direct profile ids or `chooseOne` pools. `chooseOne`
selection is deterministic for the request seed and step, so the choice is
reproducible while still spreading traffic across the pool.

Current default routing intent:

- all modes prefer the configured OpenRouter DeepSeek profile for planner,
  generation, and assessment
- optional presentation uses the configured OpenRouter DeepSeek profile when it
  is enabled
- OpenAI and Ollama profiles remain bounded fallbacks where configured and
  available

Routing is fail-open where possible:

- invalid chain entries are skipped with warnings
- empty chains fall back to safe backend defaults
- transient provider or upstream failures advance to the next chain entry
- non-transient errors stop chain advancement for that step

Routing-chain exhaustion is expected workflow data. Review and initial
generation paths carry the exhausted reason code and attempts directly instead
of converting those outcomes through exception-message control flow.

Execution metadata and step signals record selected profile lineage, fallback
attempts, and routing reason codes for trace inspection.

## What gets recorded

Workflow output is spread across a few metadata surfaces:

- `metadata.workflow` records workflow lineage
- `metadata.execution[]` records execution events, including planner influence
- TRACE or provenance fields describe answer behavior and trace presentation

Those records describe different parts of the same run. Planner influence is
recorded as lineage. TRACE fields describe how the answer was produced and
presented, not why a routing chain was selected.

### Step records

Each `StepRecord` includes an outcome with `status`, `summary`, `artifacts`,
`signals`, and optional `recommendations`.

`signals` are machine-readable control indicators used by transition logic.
They are not general telemetry.

For `assess` steps, use `reviewDecision` and `reviewReason`. When
`reviewDecision` is `revise`, `signals` may also include
`revisionInstruction`. Assess signals may also include TRACE alignment and
flattened final posture axes.

Failed assess steps caused by invalid review parser output do not include
`reviewDecision`, `reviewReason`, or `revisionInstruction`. They may include:

- `reviewParseStatus`
- `reviewParseFailureReason`
- `reviewParseFailureMessage`
- `reviewParseOutputLength`
- `reviewParseIssueCount`
- `reviewParseFirstIssuePath`
- `reviewParseFirstIssueCode`

Example assess signals:

```json
{
    "reviewDecision": "finalize",
    "reviewReason": "Draft is complete.",
    "traceAlignment": "aligned"
}
```

```json
{
    "reviewDecision": "revise",
    "reviewReason": "Tone is too stiff.",
    "revisionInstruction": "Use simpler, more natural wording.",
    "traceAlignment": "misaligned",
    "traceAlignmentReason": "Delivered posture was broader than target.",
    "finalTemperamentTightness": 5,
    "finalTemperamentAttribution": 4
}
```

`recommendations` are guidance only. Backend legality checks still decide which
transitions can run.

Step records need to stay serializable, bounded, and safe to expose in trace or
provenance contexts. They should not include raw prompts, raw model output,
full planner payloads, or unbounded tool results.

### Workflow metadata

For all profiles, blocked-before-generation and no-generation outcomes produce
a valid `WorkflowRecord`.

That record includes `workflowId`, `workflowName`, `status='degraded'`,
`terminationReason`, `stepCount`, `maxSteps`, and `maxDurationMs`.

When generation never occurred:

- `steps` may be empty when termination happens before the first executable
  step
- if any step executed before termination, recorded steps stay chronologically
  ordered with valid parent references

Profiles use the shared termination reason vocabulary rather than ad hoc
termination reason strings.

### Answer receipts and trace placement

Footnote can show compact workflow information near answers and richer detail
in traces.

The answer surface stays small. It can show the mode, whether review ran,
whether fallback happened, and whether a trace link is available. Detailed step
lists belong in the trace.

Short receipt text examples:

- `Answered in Balanced mode`
- `Reviewed before final answer`
- `Review skipped`
- `Planner fallback`
- `Grounding evidence was not available`

Answer footer:

- mode
- short review or fallback summary
- trace link

Trace page:

- step order
- planner lineage
- stop reasons
- technical detail that explains the run

Docs:

- internal profile names
- architecture terms
- runtime boundaries

Information that explains the run after the fact usually belongs in the trace.
Information that helps the reader understand the answer at a glance can appear
in the footer.

### Review, fallback, and grounded wording

A review label means a review step ran. It does not mean the answer was
verified.

Use wording such as `reviewed`, `revised`, `skipped`, and `fallback`. Avoid
stronger claims such as `verified`.

Fallback should be visible in the trace. A fallback is not automatically a bad
result; it can mean Footnote returned the best available answer after one step
failed. If review failed open, search was unavailable, or a limit stopped the
workflow, the trace should say so.

Grounded mode describes evidence posture, not truth. UI copy can say that
Grounded mode used available source signals, that citations were included, or
that grounding evidence was not available for a response. That wording should
come from metadata such as citations, source usage, search or tool result
evidence, or an explicit evidence-unavailable state.

The mode name alone is not evidence. If runtime did not retrieve sources, check
citations, or record grounding evidence, UI copy should not imply that it did.

## Runtime boundaries

The Execution Contract sets the run rules. The workflow records the step
pattern used for the run. The orchestrator coordinates the request and
response. Planner suggests how to handle the request. Adapters run
provider-specific work. Trace and provenance explain what happened.

The web UI renders facts returned by the backend. It does not infer new
workflow meanings from raw metadata, invent budget numbers, or hide fallback to
make a run look cleaner.

Use this split when ownership is unclear:

| Concern             | Engine core                                                                                       | Workflow profile                                                        | Adapters and callers                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step legality       | handles the legality check before execution                                                       | declares intended flow and policy toggles                               | supplies policy and uses engine legality results           |
| Limits              | handles hard-stop checks and stop-reason mapping                                                  | declares default budgets within the shared limits model                 | passes config and surfaces the final result                |
| Workflow state      | tracks step count, token totals, current step, and lineage progression                            | declares expected step shape                                            | treats engine-produced workflow state as the runtime state |
| Step execution      | runs concrete steps today (`generate`, `assess`, refinement `generate`) and records step outcomes | defines step-specific behavior such as review parsing                   | builds requests and calls runtimes or providers            |
| Termination reasons | assigns shared termination reasons                                                                | can request stop using shared reason handling                           | persists and returns engine-assigned reasons unchanged     |
| Fail-open behavior  | handles degraded fail-open workflow behavior                                                      | can define recoverable profile behavior within shared fail-open meaning | keeps telemetry or persistence failures out of user blocks |

These rules stay stable as profiles expand:

- no step runs unless policy and legality allow it
- engine checks limits before bounded step execution
- engine assigns limit-exhaustion reasons
- profile recommendations are guidance; transition decisions still pass through
  the runtime checks
- mode chooses the kind of run first
- profile chooses the executable step shape second
- callers wire workflow into the app; workflow timing and legality come from
  the runtime path

## Workflow profile contract

Executable workflow profiles satisfy the contract defined in:

```text
packages/backend/src/services/workflowProfileContract.ts
```

Required profile fields:

- `profileId`
- `profileVersion`
- `displayName`
- `workflowName`
- `policy`
- `defaultLimits`
- `requiredHooks.initialStep`
- `requiredHooks.canEmitGeneration()`
- `requiredHooks.classifyNoGeneration(reasonCode)`

The policy defines capability toggles such as `enablePlanning`,
`enableToolUse`, `enableReplanning`, `enableGeneration`, `enableAssessment`,
and `enableRevision`.

The default limits define hard caps such as `maxWorkflowSteps`, `maxToolCalls`,
`maxPlanCycles`, `maxReviewCycles`, `maxDeliberationCalls` (compatibility
field), `maxTokensTotal`, and `maxDurationMs`.

Optional profile extensions can support review and refinement behavior. The
shared no-generation classification, disposition, and termination-reason
mapping remain part of the required profile contract.

## Limits and no-generation behavior

Workflow limits are backend-enforced stops, not model suggestions.

`WorkflowPolicy` defines legal transitions and capability toggles.

`ExecutionLimits` defines hard caps: `maxWorkflowSteps`, `maxToolCalls`,
`maxPlanCycles`, `maxReviewCycles`, `maxDeliberationCalls` (compatibility),
`maxTokensTotal`, and `maxDurationMs`.

Model output can recommend transitions only where policy allows. If a limit
stops a run, the workflow record includes that stop reason.

`workflow.limitStop.stoppedBeforeStepKind` records the next step that the
exhausted limit prevented. This keeps a pre-generation stop distinct from a
run that generated an answer and then lacked budget for assessment or
revision. Token accounting includes planner, generation, assessment, and
revision model calls when provider usage is available. Before a counted model
step, the engine makes a conservative provider-neutral estimate from the
request messages and reserves the remaining output allowance against the
cumulative budget. Requests without an explicit output limit receive the
workflow default before they reach a runtime. Provider usage remains
authoritative: if a provider reports more than the admitted allowance, the
engine records the actual step usage, stops further deliberation, and reports
`budget_exhausted_tokens` instead of claiming a clean completion. Step-level
`usage` and backend-estimated `cost` remain the canonical trace accounting
records; UIs must label sums as partial when any executed model step lacks cost
data.

Profiles may narrow budgets. Hard-limit enforcement still happens in the
engine. Adapters may pass configured limits, but exhausted-limit reason codes
come from the workflow runtime.

No-generation outcomes still need valid workflow metadata.

| Condition                                              | Surface to caller | Internal termination | Required `terminationReason`   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Policy blocks first `generate` transition              | yes               | yes                  | `transition_blocked_by_policy` |
| Profile disables generation (`enableGeneration=false`) | yes               | yes                  | `transition_blocked_by_policy` |
| Step budget exhausted before first generation          | no                | yes                  | `budget_exhausted_steps`       |
| Token budget exhausted before first generation         | no                | yes                  | `budget_exhausted_tokens`      |
| Time budget exhausted before first generation          | no                | yes                  | `budget_exhausted_time`        |
| Executor or runtime failure before first generation    | yes               | yes                  | `executor_error_fail_open`     |

`Surface to caller` means the caller receives an explicit no-generation result
or equivalent error instead of a generated assistant message.

`Internal termination` means the workflow record still terminates with a reason
code, even when there is no dedicated blocked UI state.

The mapping lives in `WORKFLOW_NO_GENERATION_HANDLING_MAP`:

```text
packages/backend/src/services/workflowProfileContract.ts
```

Required reason mapping:

| Reason code                               | Termination reason             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `blocked_by_policy_before_generate`       | `transition_blocked_by_policy` |
| `generation_disabled_by_profile`          | `transition_blocked_by_policy` |
| `budget_exhausted_steps_before_generate`  | `budget_exhausted_steps`       |
| `budget_exhausted_tokens_before_generate` | `budget_exhausted_tokens`      |
| `budget_exhausted_time_before_generate`   | `budget_exhausted_time`        |
| `executor_error_before_generate`          | `executor_error_fail_open`     |

Policy-blocked, generation-disabled, and executor-error outcomes are surfaced.
Pre-generation budget exhaustion is internal-only.

Blocked or no-generation outcomes are explicit. When generation did not happen,
callers return the no-generation result instead of generated content. A stop
reason should not be surfaced in one path and hidden in another unless that
rule is documented.

## Where the code lives

The workflow engine mainly powers the reviewed chat path in:

```text
packages/backend/src/services/workflowEngine.ts
```

It handles transition checks, hard limits, bounded review/refinement execution,
termination reasons, fail-open handling, `WorkflowRecord` output, and
`StepRecord` output.

The shared workflow vocabulary includes `plan`, `tool`, `generate`, `assess`,
and `finalize`.

Current implementation responsibilities:

| Component          | Responsibility                                                                                              |

| `workflowEngine`   | Runs reviewed workflow steps (`generate`, `assess`, refinement `generate`) and injected context steps.      |
| `chatOrchestrator` | Resolves mode/profile/contract, applies planner policy, and builds tool intent.                             |
| `chatService`      | Invokes `workflowEngine` and handles context-step short-circuit responses such as clarification or failure. |

Current first-slice review module posture:

- Supported modules are exactly `natural_human_style` and `concise_answer`.
- Module wording comes from shared prompts YAML fragments.
- Module selection is backend/profile-selected only.
- Planner hints and user-facing module controls are not active in this slice.

## Future work

Future workflow work may add first-class tool steps, replanning, broader
workflow diagrams, and user-facing workflow controls.

TODO(workflow-search-profile-split): Define and implement explicit split-model
execution for retrieval vs final generation. Current routing resolves one
selected response profile and may reroute that profile when search capability
is required, which prevents "search on profile A, generate on profile B" in one
request path.

Recommended boundary for that work:

- retrieval profile selection remains policy-governed and deterministic
- generation profile selection remains request or planner governed by routing
  strategy
- retrieval evidence joins runtime context and provenance before final
  generation
- trace and execution metadata report both retrieval and generation profile
  lineage

For now, workflow-facing UI should stay close to current metadata: mode, review
or fallback summary, grounding evidence availability, trace links, and
backend-provided usage data when present.
