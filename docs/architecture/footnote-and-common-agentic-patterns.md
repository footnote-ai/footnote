# Footnote and Common Agentic Patterns

This page is a translation guide.

It helps contributors map common agent vocabulary onto Footnote's architecture
without erasing Footnote's own semantics.

Use it like this:

- Start with the Footnote term.
- Use the common pattern only as orientation.
- Footnote's constraints are the real rule.

## Quick Crosswalk

- Routing -> workflow mode selection and workflow resolution
- Planning -> bounded planner step
- Reflection -> review / refinement path, plus future bounded TRACE refinement
- Tool use -> Execution Contract-limited tool execution
- Memory -> planned, bounded by provenance and governance
- MCP -> protocol boundary for capability access, not policy authority

## Routing

**What common pattern it resembles**

Routing in other systems usually means deciding which execution path to take.
That may mean a balanced path, a grounded path, or a tool-assisted path.

**What Footnote calls it**

Footnote uses a workflow mode for the high-level run choice and a
shared reviewed workflow shape for concrete execution.

Current examples:

- workflow mode: `express`, `balanced`, `grounded`
- workflow shape: reviewed (`generate -> assess -> planner re-entry -> generate`)

**What constraints Footnote adds**

- Routing stays inside Execution Contract guardrails.
- Workflow mode and workflow shape are related, but not the same thing.
- Backend owns the final routing decision.
- Missing or unknown routing input falls back fail-open.

**What it is not**

- not a free-form runtime graph builder
- not per-request workflow scripting
- not a license for callers or adapters to invent new authority semantics

## Planning

**What common pattern it resembles**

Planning resembles the common planner step that decides the next action shape.

**What Footnote calls it**

Footnote treats planning as a bounded planner step. It is part of orchestration,
not the owner of orchestration.

**What constraints Footnote adds**

- Planning is bounded in purpose and shape.
- Planner output can be adjusted or rejected by policy.
- Planner metadata is recorded as execution/provenance data.
- Planning must stay serializable and inspectable.
- Planning does not override backend control logic.

**What it is not**

- not unbounded planning loops
- not a self-directed agent deciding its own authority
- not a replacement for Execution Contract policy

## Reflection / Review

**What common pattern it resembles**

This resembles reflection, critique, or reviewer passes used in other agent
systems.

**What Footnote calls it**

Today Footnote has an engine-bounded review / refinement path in the shared reviewed workflow.
Future TRACE refinement may add another bounded refinement seam, but still under
Footnote control.

**What constraints Footnote adds**

- Review is optional and policy-gated.
- Review decisions are bounded: finalize or revise.
- Revise decisions include explicit `revisionInstruction` guidance for the
  follow-up refinement `generate` step.
- Revision cannot loosen grounding or provenance rules.
- TRACE remains Footnote-specific response temperament metadata, not a generic
  self-improvement score.
- Backend remains the authority for when review can happen and when it stops.

**What it is not**

- not uncontrolled self-critique
- not an endless improve-until-perfect loop
- not permission to rewrite provenance or blur sourced versus inferred content

## Tool Use

**What common pattern it resembles**

This resembles standard tool calling: request a capability, then execute it if
allowed.

**What Footnote calls it**

Footnote treats this as Execution Contract-limited tool execution with explicit
intent, eligibility, outcome state, and reason codes.

**What constraints Footnote adds**

- Tool use is governed by backend policy, not by tool adapters.
- Tool outcomes are normalized as `executed`, `skipped`, or `failed`.
- Non-executed outcomes need explicit reason codes.
- Provenance, reviewability, and cost accounting stay Footnote-owned.
- Fail-open behavior remains the default unless an explicit policy says
  otherwise.

**What it is not**

- not tools deciding policy
- not silent tool-intent dropping
- not a hidden side channel around provenance or review semantics

## Memory

**What common pattern it resembles**

This resembles agent memory, but this part is mostly planned rather than
current.

**What Footnote calls it**

Memory is planned work in Footnote. Near-term direction is bounded memory, not
open-ended agent identity or autonomous long-horizon recall.

**What constraints Footnote adds**

- Memory must fit provenance and governance requirements.
- Memory should stay behind Footnote's backend boundary.
- Any public memory-facing behavior must stay serializable and inspectable.
- Memory only belongs if it improves user-visible transparency or
  steerability.

**What it is not**

- not a commitment to broad long-term memory now
- not hidden persistence that weakens user understanding
- not a reason to bypass provenance, review, or authority boundaries

## MCP as a Protocol Boundary

**What common pattern it resembles**

MCP resembles a protocol layer for exposing tools or resources in a more
uniform way.

**What Footnote calls it**

For this pass, MCP is best understood as a possible protocol boundary for
capability access.

**What constraints Footnote adds**

- MCP is useful if it reduces coupling at the tool/resource boundary.
- MCP is not useful if it only adds protocol ceremony or just renames existing
  registry concepts.
- MCP does not replace backend policy, provenance, review, or governance
  authority.
- Local MCP exploration is valid, but this page does not commit Footnote to an
  MCP migration.

**What it is not**

- not a default replacement for the current tool architecture
- not policy authority
- not a replacement for Footnote's authority boundaries

## Bottom Line

Footnote uses some patterns people will recognize from agent systems.

But those patterns only help if they are translated into Footnote's own terms
and constraints.

The semantic center stays the same:

- Execution Contract governs authority
- workflow modes and workflow shape govern run shape
- TRACE, provenance, and steerability stay Footnote-native
- backend remains the control-plane boundary
